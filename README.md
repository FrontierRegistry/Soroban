Frontier Registry for Soroban
Beginning of the Open Source Code Repo for the Soroban Smart Contract build with Stellar. 
This Repo is being established July 26, 2024 as part of the Kickstarter application for SDF following the Bootcamp x Stellar & Bigger.

Please refer to the original REPO for Frontier Registry.  
We will be adding to this REPO once we get the go-ahead to start building on Soroban. 

IN the meantime, please have a look at our MVP https://frontier-dapp.netlify.app
We are always open to feedback.
